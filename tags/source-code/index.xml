      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project 
OpenFOAM 4.0 was released yesterday with the latest updates and bug fixes. Claiming to introduce &amp;ldquo;significant improvements and changes to general usability, post-processing, case management and software management&amp;rdquo;, and having a very similar code structure and usage with respect to previous version, it makes sense to do the change.
Therefore, olaFoam has already been adapted to be compiled and work under OpenFOAM 4.</description>
