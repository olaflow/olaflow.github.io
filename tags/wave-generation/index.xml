      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project 
Today the OLAFOAM project advances a step further in the simulation of laboratory facilities wave-making technologies. With the extension of the moving-boundary module to include flap wavemakers, OLAFOAM is now capable of reproducing the most widely-spread wave generation systems (piston and flap). Furthermore, the piston type includes an active wave absorption system to generate the selected waves while self-adjusting to absorb any incident wave to the boundary.</description>
