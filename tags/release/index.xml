      <description>It has been almost two years since I released olaFoam, after finishing my PhD and starting a new postdoc at the National University of Singapore. In this time I have added functionalities (piston and flap wavemakers, simultaneous wave and current generation, additional wave theories&amp;hellip;), increased performance and compatibility, and fixed bugs. Today I continue walking ahead towards a bigger project.
It is my pleasure to introduce olaFlow CFD suite, the new evolution in active wave generation and absorption frameworks in OpenFOAMÂ®.</description>

      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project OLAFOAM is the evolution of IHFOAM, a well-known three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver for free surface flows, and is born with the spirit of providing the latest advances for the simulation of wave dynamics to the OpenFOAM and FOAM-extend communities.
At this initial stage OLAFOAM is a slightly modified version of IHFOAM, but new implementations and updates (see roadmap in the wiki site) will be readily available soon.</description>
