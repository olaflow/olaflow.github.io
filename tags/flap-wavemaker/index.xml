      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project  This new job has involved a significant coding effort and a redesign of the previous boundary condition for wall displacement. The name of the BC has also changed to reflect the present universal approach; now it is called wavemakerMovement instead of multiPistonMovement. Slight changes in the tutorials were required to adjust for such changes, although the basic functionality remains.</description>
