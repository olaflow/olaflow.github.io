      <description>It is great to start 2018 having a paper published, the first with olaFlow. In Simulating Breaking Focused Waves in CFD: Methodology for Controlled Generation of First and Second Order we apply a methodology to accurately generate wave breaking with focussing waves, both for laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with olaFlow CFD Suite.Simulating Breaking Focused Waves in CFD: Methodology for Controlled Generation of First and Second Order A new methodology is proposed for the generation of breaking focused waves in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.</description>
