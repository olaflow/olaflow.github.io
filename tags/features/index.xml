Today the OLAFOAM project advances a step further in the simulation of laboratory facilities wave-making technologies. With the extension of the moving-boundary module to include flap wavemakers, OLAFOAM is now capable of reproducing the most widely-spread wave generation systems (piston and flap). Furthermore, the piston type includes an active wave absorption system to generate the selected waves while self-adjusting to absorb any incident wave to the boundary.</description>

The development of olaFoam is ongoing. Day by day we are testing new features and generating challenging simulations that push OpenFOAM simulations one step further.
Today I would like to present an implementation of the pneumatic tsunami wave generator, a pressure-driven device that can generate very long waves and is especially good at simulating the initial phase that precedes a tsunami, in which water retreats from the shore.</description>

It is my pleasure to announce the release of one of the long-awaited features in olaFoam: simultaneous generation and absorption of waves and currents.
Check this video out (best in 1080p):

 
A 2D wave flume is set up with different wave conditions. From top to bottom you can see: waves only, current only, and simultaneous waves and current traveling in the same and in opposite directions.</description>
