      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project  This new job has involved a significant coding effort and a redesign of the previous boundary condition for wall displacement. The name of the BC has also changed to reflect the present universal approach; now it is called wavemakerMovement instead of multiPistonMovement. Slight changes in the tutorials were required to adjust for such changes, although the basic functionality remains.</description>

      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project Today I would like to present an implementation of the pneumatic tsunami wave generator, a pressure-driven device that can generate very long waves and is especially good at simulating the initial phase that precedes a tsunami, in which water retreats from the shore. Check the video out:
 As you can see, the leftmost deposit has a newly-developed boundary condition that induces a pressure gradient and drives the water.</description>

      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project Check this video out (best in 1080p):
 A 2D wave flume is set up with different wave conditions. From top to bottom you can see: waves only, current only, and simultaneous waves and current traveling in the same and in opposite directions.
It is interesting to note the effects caused by wave and current interaction: variations in the velocity field and the Doppler effect affecting wave propagation.</description>
