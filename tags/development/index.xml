      <description>Today we have an important announcement for the olaFlow community. The long wait to have access to the Extended Range Active Wave Absorption (ER-AWA) introduced in our previous post is over.
The traditional AWA (SW-AWA) is based on the shallow water approximation for linear wave theory, thus, it does not perform well in intermediate and deep water conditions because it produces reflections above 20%. ER-AWA reduces the number of initial assumptions, since it is based on the general linear wave theory, valid at any water depth.</description>
