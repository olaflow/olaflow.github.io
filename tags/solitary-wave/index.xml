      <description>Today we are glad to present you Laboratory-scale swash flows generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope, our new paper published in the prestigious Journal of Fluid Mechanics.
Laboratory-scale swash flows generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope The main goal of this paper is to provide insights into swash flow dynamics, generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the details of runup and rundown processes.</description>
