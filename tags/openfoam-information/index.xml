      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project The starting point shall be answering, what is OpenFOAM? The answer might be simple, but is has a lot of complex implications: OpenFOAM is a multiphysics CFD open source code that is under active development. It derives from an early code created at Imperial College London called FOAM, and it has evolved a lot since those days.</description>
