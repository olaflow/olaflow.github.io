      <description>This is a followup post of: Turbulence models for wave simulations
Since turbulence is an extremely important physical process, especially when studying wave breaking or wave impacts on a structure, every attempt to enhance two equation models, the most widely used today, takes CFD one step further.
Today olaFlow CFD is updating its turbulence modelling library to include the most recent advances.
This library is part of the olaFlow supplementary materials repository:</description>

      <description>Turbulence is an extremely important physical process, especially when studying wave breaking or wave impacts on a structure. However, OpenFOAMÂ® does not provide by default incompressible turbulence models for multiphase systems (i.e. models that take into account the density variation between the air and water phases). This often results in a well-known excessive wave height damping (due to the increasing nut) as the simulation progresses, due to turbulence build-up.</description>
