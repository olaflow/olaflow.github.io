      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project Check this video out (best in 1080p):
 A 2D wave flume is set up with different wave conditions. From top to bottom you can see: waves only, current only, and simultaneous waves and current traveling in the same and in opposite directions.
It is interesting to note the effects caused by wave and current interaction: variations in the velocity field and the Doppler effect affecting wave propagation.</description>
