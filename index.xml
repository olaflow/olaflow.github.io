      <description>Today we are glad to announce that Enhancing active wave absorption in RANS models has just been published at Applied Ocean Research.
You can access the paper for free during the first 50 days using the following link:

Enhancing active wave absorption in RANS models In this work we review the most common methods for absorbing waves in Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The limitations of active wave absorption, originating from its initial assumption of linear wave theory in shallow waters are overcome and the range of applicability is extended to any relative water depth conditions by re-deriving the formulation.</description>

      <description>Today we have an important announcement for the olaFlow community. The long wait to have access to the Extended Range Active Wave Absorption (ER-AWA) introduced in our previous post is over.
The traditional AWA (SW-AWA) is based on the shallow water approximation for linear wave theory, thus, it does not perform well in intermediate and deep water conditions because it produces reflections above 20%. ER-AWA reduces the number of initial assumptions, since it is based on the general linear wave theory, valid at any water depth.</description>

      <description>This is a followup post of: Turbulence models for wave simulations
Since turbulence is an extremely important physical process, especially when studying wave breaking or wave impacts on a structure, every attempt to enhance two equation models, the most widely used today, takes CFD one step further.
Today olaFlow CFD is updating its turbulence modelling library to include the most recent advances.
This library is part of the olaFlow supplementary materials repository:</description>

      <description>We have just included olaFlow in the Zenodo database, after preparing the code for minting a DOI. This allows users to have a perpetual reference for citing the software, which works in the same way as the DOI for papers.
The DOI identifier for olaFlow is: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1297012
Also, the References section of this web site has been updated to reflect the new changes, making it easier for the users to decide the best way to cite olaFlow.</description>

      <description>Today we are glad to present you Laboratory-scale swash flows generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope, our new paper published in the prestigious Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

Laboratory-scale swash flows generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope The main goal of this paper is to provide insights into swash flow dynamics, generated by a non-breaking solitary wave on a steep slope. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations are conducted to investigate the details of runup and rundown processes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence models for wave simulations</title>
      <link>https://olaflow.github.io/blog/turbulence-models-for-wave-simulations/</link>

      <description>Turbulence is an extremely important physical process, especially when studying wave breaking or wave impacts on a structure. However, OpenFOAM® does not provide by default incompressible turbulence models for multiphase systems (i.e. models that take into account the density variation between the air and water phases). This often results in a well-known excessive wave height damping (due to the increasing nut) as the simulation progresses, due to turbulence build-up.</description>

      <title>olaFlow coupling with isoAdvector</title>

      <guid>https://olaflow.github.io/blog/olaflow-coupling-with-isoadvector/</guid>
      <description>IsoAdvector is a new method for two-phase flow advection developed by Johan Roenby.
Leaving major technical details out (you can find all the details in A computational method for sharp interface advection), isoAdvector produces an extremely sharp interface at a fraction of the computational cost of previous surface tracking methods, because it reduces the number of geometric operations needed for free surface advection.
The sharpness of the interface is clear when comparing the results of a dam break test case against the solution obtained with OpenFOAM®&amp;rsquo;s MULES solver.</description>

      <description>It is great to start 2018 having a paper published, the first with olaFlow. In Simulating Breaking Focused Waves in CFD: Methodology for Controlled Generation of First and Second Order we apply a methodology to accurately generate wave breaking with focussing waves, both for laboratory experiments and numerical simulations with olaFlow CFD Suite.

      <description>It has been almost two years since I released olaFoam, after finishing my PhD and starting a new postdoc at the National University of Singapore. In this time I have added functionalities (piston and flap wavemakers, simultaneous wave and current generation, additional wave theories&amp;hellip;), increased performance and compatibility, and fixed bugs. Today I continue walking ahead towards a bigger project.

It is my pleasure to introduce olaFlow CFD suite, the new evolution in active wave generation and absorption frameworks in OpenFOAM®.</description>

Today the OLAFOAM project advances a step further in the simulation of laboratory facilities wave-making technologies. With the extension of the moving-boundary module to include flap wavemakers, OLAFOAM is now capable of reproducing the most widely-spread wave generation systems (piston and flap). Furthermore, the piston type includes an active wave absorption system to generate the selected waves while self-adjusting to absorb any incident wave to the boundary.</description>

      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project 
Wavestar is a Danish company that developed a new concept for a wave energy converter (WEC) device. The machine is a platform in which several floaters are attached to a hydraulic system that generates energy as they oscillate up and down with the waves.
The strongest point of this technology is that it can be built side by side with wind turbines in intermediate water depths, and that the energy production can be better anticipated, as wave forecasts are more reliable than wind forecasts.</description>

The latest releases that have widened the spectrum of the OpenFOAM environment may confuse some of the new and not so new users. I myself did not know about certain of the new tastes that OpenFOAM has until very recently. This is why I decided to create this post, to sketch what is what and who is who in the OpenFOAM environment.</description>

      <description>This is an old post saved for archival purposes only. The olaFoam project is now the olaFlow project 
OpenFOAM 4.0 was released yesterday with the latest updates and bug fixes. Claiming to introduce &amp;ldquo;significant improvements and changes to general usability, post-processing, case management and software management&amp;rdquo;, and having a very similar code structure and usage with respect to previous version, it makes sense to do the change.
Therefore, olaFoam has already been adapted to be compiled and work under OpenFOAM 4.</description>

The development of olaFoam is ongoing. Day by day we are testing new features and generating challenging simulations that push OpenFOAM simulations one step further.
Today I would like to present an implementation of the pneumatic tsunami wave generator, a pressure-driven device that can generate very long waves and is especially good at simulating the initial phase that precedes a tsunami, in which water retreats from the shore.</description>

OLAFOAM is the evolution of IHFOAM, a well-known three-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver for free surface flows, and is born with the spirit of providing the latest advances for the simulation of wave dynamics to the OpenFOAM and FOAM-extend communities.</description>
